    '''
    Rafiki's base model class that Rafiki models must extend.

    Rafiki models must implement all abstract methods below, according to the specification of its associated task (see :ref:`tasks`).
    They configure how this model template will be trained, evaluated, tuned, serialized and served on Rafiki.

    In the model's ``__init__`` method, call ``super().__init__(**knobs)`` as the first line, 
    followed by the model's initialization logic. The model should be initialize itself with ``knobs``, 
    a set of generated knob values for the created model instance. 
    
    These knob values are chosen by Rafiki based on the model's knob configuration (defined in :meth:`rafiki.model.BaseModel.get_knob_config`).
    
    For example:

    ::

        def __init__(self, **knobs):
            super().__init__(**knobs)
            self.__dict__.update(knobs)
            ...
            self._build_model(self.knob1, self.knob2)

    :param knobs: Dictionary mapping knob names to knob values
    :type knobs: :obj:`rafiki.model.Knobs`
    '''   
    def __init__(self, **knobs: Knobs):
        pass

        '''
        Return a dictionary that defines the search space for this model template's knobs 
        (i.e. knobs' names, their types & their ranges). 

        Over the course of training, your model will be initialized with different values of knobs within this search space
        to maximize this modelâ€™s performance.

        Refer to :ref:`model-tuning` to understand more about how this works.
