What is SingaAuto?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*SingaAuto* is a distributed system that trains machine learning (ML) models and deploys trained models, built with ease-of-use in mind.
To do so, it leverages on automated machine learning (AutoML).

For *Application Developers* and *Application Users*, without any ML expertise, they can:

- Create a model training job for supported tasks, with their own datasets
- Deploy an ensemble of trained models for inference
- Integrate model predictions in their apps over HTTP

For *Model Developers*, they can:

- Contribute to SingaAuto's pool of model templates

Check out :ref:`quick-setup` to deploy/develop SingaAuto on your machine, and/or :ref:`quick-start` to use a deployed instance of SingaAuto.
